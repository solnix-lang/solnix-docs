**Date**: 2026-02-18  
**Release notes**: [View on GitHub](https://github.com/solnix-lang/solnix-compiler/releases/tag/v0.2.0)

---

## Overview
Release v0.2.0 introduces significant language enhancements focused on safety (guards), complex control flow (else blocks), and modernized networking support (Ring Buffer).

## Key Features

### Safety & Control Flow
- **If/Else Support**: Full support for conditional branching in units.
- **Guard Pattern**: Introduction of `if guard(ptr) { ... } else { ... }` for mandatory null-pointer verification, ensuring compatibility with the strict eBPF verifier.

### Updated Map Support
- **Ring Buffer**: Native support for high-performance `.ringbuf` maps.
- **Dynamic Sizing**: Ring buffer sizes are now dynamic rather than hardcoded.
- **New Map Methods**: 
    - `.update(key, val)`
    - `.reserve(Event)`
    - `.submit(ptr)`

### Advanced Observability
- **Extended Context Helpers**: Support for `get_current_comm`, `get_current_task`, and `get_ktime_ns`.
- **Memory Probes**: New `probe_read_user_str` and `probe_read_kernel_str` for safe string extraction from different memory spaces.
- **Event Syntax**: Introduction of `event { ... }` blocks for structured data transmission.

## Improvements & Fixes
- **Diagnostics**: Enhanced compiler error reporting with source location pointers.
- **IR Stability**: Improved robustness of the Intermediate Representation lowering phase.
- **C Backend**: More efficient C code generation for better kernel loader compatibility.
